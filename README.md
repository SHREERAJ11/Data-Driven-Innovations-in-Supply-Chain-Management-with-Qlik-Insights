<h3> 5. Data Preparation </h3>

<h5> Prepare the Data for Visualization </h5>


Preparing the data for visualization involves cleaning the data to remove irrelevant or missing data, transforming the data into a format that can be easily visualized, exploring the data to identify patterns and trends, filtering the data to focus on specific subsets of data, preparing the data for visualization software, and ensuring the data is accurate and complete. This process helps to make the data easily understandable and ready for creating visualizations to gain insights into performance and efficiency. Since the data is already cleaned, we can move to visualization.
<h3> 6. Data Visualization </h3>

<h5> Data Visualization Process </h5>


Data visualization is the process of creating graphical representations of data to help people understand and explore the information. The goal of data visualization is to make complex data sets more accessible, intuitive, and easier to interpret. By using visual elements such as charts, graphs, and maps, data visualizations can help people quickly identify patterns, trends, and outliers in the data.
Number of Unique Visualizations

The number of unique visualizations that can be created with a given dataset is substantial. Some common types of visualizations used to analyze supply chain performance include bar charts, line charts, heat maps, scatter plots, pie charts, and maps. These visualizations can be used to compare performance, track changes over time, show distribution and relationships between variables, and provide a breakdown of revenue and customer demographics, workload, resource allocation, and location of supply chain operations.
<h3> 7. Visualizations </h3>
 
<h5> Dashboard </h5>


A dashboard is a graphical user interface (GUI) that displays information and data in an organized, easy-to-read format. Dashboards are often used to provide real-time monitoring and analysis of data and are typically designed for a specific purpose or use case. Dashboards can be used in a variety of settings, such as business, finance, manufacturing, healthcare, and many other industries. They can be used to track key performance indicators (KPIs), monitor performance metrics, and display data in the form of charts, graphs, and tables.
Responsive Design of Dashboard

The design of the dashboard is responsive, ensuring it adapts to various screen sizes and devices, providing a seamless user experience.
<h4> Story </h4>


A data story is a way of presenting data and analysis in a narrative format, with the goal of making the information more engaging and easier to understand. A data story typically includes a clear introduction that sets the stage and explains the context for the data, a body that presents the data and analysis in a logical and systematic way, and a conclusion that summarizes the key findings and highlights their implications. Data stories can be told using a variety of mediums, such as reports, presentations, interactive visualizations, and videos.
<h3> 8. Performance Testing </h3>
